# Climate Change on Singapore: Pluvial Flooding Projected Risks and Analysis
Master of Architecture Thesis Report AY 2022/2023 
Thesis Supervisor: Dr Rudi Stouffs

## Research Abstract
When what used to be 500-year floods are now occurring every 24.4 years, it becomes clear that we have entered the
era of climate crisis. Increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather means we can no longer predict future weather
reliably based on past data and climate patterns, and past drainage and water management infrastructure might soon
become obsolete due to their inflexibility and inability to cope with longer periods of intense rainfall.
This research takes a quantitative and systematic approach to assess and manage the risks of Pluvial Floods in
Singapore. This study first discusses how climate change exacerbates flooding in Singapore, as well as the importance
and urgency of preparing for future floods in Singapore. Then, the Pluvial Flooding Risks Framework is introduced
to identify sites that would pose high risks to human lives and the economy. Various GIS datasets are analysed to
sieve out sites to prioritise for in-land flood prevention and the Marine Parade/Kembangan area is chosen as the
project site for further design intervention because it poses the greatest risk to both. Subsequently, a more detailed
hydrological analysis is done through Grasshopper with the Kangaroo solver to simulate existing water drainage
patterns and to study how building footprint and typography affect the hydrology of the area. Lastly, this thesis
examines currently available drainage solutions and suggests some suitable methods that would continue to be
relevant in the age of rapid climate change.

## Research Aim and Objectives
Firstly, the development of a new framework to sieve out locations to prioritise for in-land flood prevention - Pluvial
Flooding Risk Framework which uses GIS data analysis to identify sites that would pose high risks to human lives
and the economy.
Secondly, conduct a detailed hydrological analysis to find out the exact location of the problematic areas within
the highest-risk site. The Kangaroo step solver in Grasshopper is used to simulate existing water drainage patterns
and to study how building footprint and typography affect the hydrology of the area, some urban strategies with
the potential to alleviate flooding are also suggested by evaluating different arrangements of building footprint and
orientation against one another quantitatively.
Lastly, this thesis examines some of the currently available drainage infrastructures and suggests some suitable
methods that would continue to be relevant in the age of rapid climate change.
This thesis report lays the groundwork for the thesis design project next semester. Knowledge gained from this
research would be translated into a design that aims to protect the highest risks areas in Singapore adequately from
the impacts of pluvial flooding.
